# Weather-Dashboard

## Description

Developers are often tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context of their own. Third-party APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. 

Our challenge this week is to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS. Using the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to retrieve weather data for cities and also using `localStorage` to store any persistent data.
